rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
rf_predictions = rf_model.predict(X_test)
print("Random Forest Classifier")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, rf_predictions))
print(classification_report(y_test, rf_predictions))

# Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
sgd_model = SGDClassifier(random_state=42)
sgd_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
sgd_predictions = sgd_model.predict(X_test)
print("Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, sgd_predictions))
print(classification_report(y_test, sgd_predictions))

Outlier Detection:

python
# Function to detect outliers
def detect_outliers_iqr(dataframe):
    outliers = {}
    for col in dataframe.columns:
        if dataframe[col].dtype in ['int64', 'float64']:
            Q1 = dataframe[col].quantile(0.25)
            Q3 = dataframe[col].quantile(0.75)
            IQR = Q3 - Q1
            lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
            upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
            outlier_indices = dataframe[(dataframe[col] < lower_bound) | (dataframe[col] > upper_bound)].index
            outliers[col] = outlier_indices.tolist()
    return outliers

# Detect outliers in the dataset
outliers = detect_outliers_iqr(data)
print("Outliers detected:")
print(outliers)
Visualization:

python
# Generating a word cloud for the feature names
features_text = " ".join(data.columns)
wordcloud = WordCloud(width=800, height=400, background_color='white').generate(features_text)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis('off')
plt.title("Word Cloud of Feature Names")
plt.show()

# Box plots for outlier detection
features = ['fixed acidity', 'volatile acidity', 'citric acid', 'residual sugar', 'chlorides', 'density', 'pH', 'sulphates', 'alcohol']

plt.figure(figsize=(15, 10))
for i, feature in enumerate(features, 1):
    plt.subplot(3, 3, i)
    plt.boxplot(data[feature])
    plt.title(feature)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
